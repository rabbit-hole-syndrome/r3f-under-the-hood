# R3F Under the Hood

This is the source code for [I wish I knew this before using React Three Fiber](https://youtu.be/DPl34H2ISsk).

It is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the demo.

## File Structure

The source code for each demo is located under the `./demos` folder. They can be viewed in the browser by navigating to `/three` or `/r3f`, or by clicking the links in the [index page](http://localhost:3000).
